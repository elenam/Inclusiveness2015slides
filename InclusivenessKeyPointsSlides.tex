Similar problems are faced by ethnic minorities or anyone else who doesn't look like a stereotypical  person working in a tech field.

\item {\it \href{http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/02/10/teacher_bias_in_math_new_study_finds_teachers_grade_boys_more_generously.html}{A study by Victor Lavy of the University of Warwick in England and Edith Sand of Tel Aviv University (2015)}}.
\item Three groups of Israeli students, grade 6 to end of high school.
\item 2 math exams: one graded by outsiders not given the students' names, the other by teachers who knew their names.
\item In the exam graded anonymously, girls outperformed boys.
\item In  the exam graded by teachers who knew their names, boys outperformed girls.
\item There was no similar effect in other areas (e.g. language). 
\item Studies show that belief in one's abilities greatly increases performance. 
\item Since girls aren't expected, or encouraged, to do well in math, they perform worse or drop out.
\item The teachers in the study were women.
