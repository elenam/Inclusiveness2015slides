Similar problems are faced by ethnic minorities or anyone else who doesn't look like a stereotypical  person working in a tech field.

Isis Wenger, a platform engineer at OneLogin, was photographed for a recruiting ad:

Comments on social media: people thought she was a photo model, not an engineer, and the quote was made up.

{\it \href{https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f}{Isis Wenger's blog post}} lists her experiences, including male colleagues throwing dollar bills at her in the office, or a colleague messaging her seeking to be ``friends with benefits''. She says it doesn't indicate that they are bad people, just that people don't know how their ``playful'' behavior affects those it's directed at.

\item {\it \href{http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/02/10/teacher_bias_in_math_new_study_finds_teachers_grade_boys_more_generously.html}{A study by Victor Lavy of the University of Warwick in England and Edith Sand of Tel Aviv University (2015)}}.
\item Three groups of Israeli students, grade 6 to end of high school.
\item 2 math exams: one graded by outsiders not given the students' names, the other by teachers who knew their names.
\item In the exam graded anonymously, girls outperformed boys.
\item In  the exam graded by teachers who knew their names, boys outperformed girls.
\item There was no similar effect in other areas (e.g. language). 
\item Studies show that belief in one's abilities greatly increases performance. 
\item Since girls aren't expected, or encouraged, to do well in math, they perform worse or drop out.
\item The teachers in the study were women.

\frametitle{Starting points for group discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why is diversity so important? 
\begin{itemize}
\item What problems arise due to lack of diversity in STEM fields?
\item How can our experiences (or lack of experience) with diversity influence us?
\end{itemize}
\item Have you encountered messages designed for women and minorities that imply that they arenâ€™t good at math or science?
\item In what instances have media tried to promote diversity in an ineffective way?
\item How do you feel diversity has affected your academic experience?
\item How can we promote diversity and inclusiveness in the Computer Science program here at Morris?
\begin{itemize}
\item What are we doing well? 
\item What can be improved?
\end{itemize}
